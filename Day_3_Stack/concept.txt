What is a Stack? 
Ans: A stack follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. 
     The last element added is the first to be removed, just like a stack of plates.

Core Operations:

1. Push: Add an item to the top of the stack.
2. Pop: Remove the top item.
3. Peek: Check the top item without removing it.
4. isEmpty: Check if the stack is empty.


Real-Life Examples:

1. Browser history (backtracking pages).
2. Undo operations in text editors.
